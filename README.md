## Welcome to the monorepo for This is Not A Drill! (TINAD)

*This is Not A Drill!* is a paid service that puts
important messages in front of your application's users,
_without code deploys_.

Some common use cases are :

* website outages / problems
* scheduled maintenance
* changes in what you offer
* changes to legal terms

TINAD gives you fine-grained control over where, when, and who sees
important messages (even down to their locale), and everything can be
setup and controlled via TINAD's dashboard.

TINAD takes care of tracking views for you, so your users are never
hit with a notification or alert they've already seen. In the
dashboard you can review who's seen what... so you're never at a loss
when your boss says, "Crap! Did you inform our users there's a problem
with the checkout step?"

TINAD is designed by an engineer, with engineering teams in mind. It's
easy to integrate into your app with a one-liner.

In this repo you'll find TINAD's API, the dashboard, and the client
SDK that is published to npm.
