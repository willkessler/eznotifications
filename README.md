# This Is Not A Drill!

![TINAD_logo](./packages/dashboard/public/ThisIsNotADrill_cutout.png)

Welcome to the monorepo for This is Not A Drill! (TINAD)

This is Not A Drill! is a paid service that puts
important messages in front of your application's users,
without any code deploys.

Some common use cases are :

* website outages / problems
* scheduled maintenance
* changes in what you offer
* changes to legal terms

It is designed by an engineer, with engineering teams in mind. It's
simple to integrate with a one-liner in your codebase. You get
fine-grained control over where, when, and who sees messages (if you
want that), and everything can be controlled and set up with TINAD's
dashboard.

TINAD takes care of tracking views for you so users are never hit with
a notification or alert they've already seen. In the dashboard, you
can find out who's seen what, so you're never at a loss when your boss
says, "Did we tell the users there's a problem with the checkout
step?"

In this repo you'll find TINAD's API, the dashboard, and the client
SDK that is published to npm.
