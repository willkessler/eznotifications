## This is Not A Drill! (TINAD) -- Main Codebase

**This is Not A Drill!** is a paid service that puts important
messages in front of your application's users _without code deploys_.

Common use cases are :

* website outages / problems
* scheduled maintenance
* changes in what you offer
* changes to legal terms

TINAD gives you fine-grained control over where, when, and who sees
important messages (right down to their locale), and everything can be
set up and controlled via TINAD's dashboard.

TINAD takes care of tracking views for you, so your users are never
hit with an alert they've already seen. In TINAD's dashboard, you can
review who's seen what, when... so you're never at a loss when your boss
says, _Crap! Did you inform our users there's a problem with the
checkout step?_

TINAD is designed by an engineer, with engineering teams in mind. It's
easy to integrate into your app with a one-liner.

In this repo you'll find TINAD's API, the dashboard, and the client
SDK that is published to npm.
